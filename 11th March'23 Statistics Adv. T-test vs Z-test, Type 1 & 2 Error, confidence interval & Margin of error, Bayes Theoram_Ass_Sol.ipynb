    "A t-test is used when the sample size is small (typically less than 30) or when the population standard deviation is unknown. It is appropriate when dealing with small samples or when the data is approximately normally distributed. \n",
    "The t-test uses a t-distribution to calculate the test statistic and determine the p-value.\n",

    "Example scenario for using a t-test: Suppose you want to compare the average heights of two groups of students, a control group and an experimental group, to see if there is a significant difference in their heights. \n",
    "You collect height data from a sample of 20 students from each group. Since the sample size is small, you would use a t-test to analyze the data.\n",

    "On the other hand, a z-test is used when the sample size is large (typically greater than 30) and the population standard deviation is known. It assumes that the data is normally distributed. \n",

The critical region is located entirely in one tail of the distribution. The null hypothesis is rejected if the test statistic falls in the critical region corresponding to that specified direction.\n",
    "Example: Let's say a researcher wants to test whether a new drug increases the average reaction time of participants. The research hypothesis would state that the drug increases reaction time.

The null hypothesis would be rejected if the test statistic falls in the upper tail, indicating a significant increase in reaction time.\n",

    "Two-tailed test: Also known as a two-sided test, a two-tailed test is used when the research hypothesis does not specify a particular direction of the effect or difference between groups. The critical region is divided into two equal parts, located in both tails of the distribution. The null hypothesis is rejected if the test statistic falls in either tail.\n",
    "Example: Consider a scenario where a researcher wants to determine if a new teaching method affects student performance.

In this case, a two-tailed test would be appropriate. The critical region would be divided into both tails of the distribution, and the null hypothesis would be rejected if the test statistic falls in either tail, indicating a significant difference in student performance.\n",

    "'''In hypothesis testing, Type 1 and Type 2 errors are two possible mistakes that can occur when making decisions about the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Type 1 error (False Positive): A Type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is rejected, even though it is true. In other words, it is the incorrect rejection of a true null hypothesis. The significance level (Î±) of the test determines the probability of committing a Type 1 error. A smaller significance level reduces the likelihood of Type 1 errors but increases the chance of Type 2 errors.\n",
    "Example scenario for a Type 1 error: Let's say a pharmaceutical company is testing a new drug for a specific medical condition. The null hypothesis is that the drug has no effect on the condition. If the company conducts a study and rejects the null hypothesis based on the data, but in reality, the drug has no effect, it would be a Type 1 error. The company would falsely conclude that the drug is effective when it's not.\n",

    "2. Type 2 error (False Negative): A Type 2 error occurs when the null hypothesis is not rejected, even though it is false. In other words, it is the failure to reject a false null hypothesis. The probability of committing a Type 2 error is influenced by factors such as the sample size, effect size, and the chosen significance level.\n",
    "Example scenario for a Type 2 error: Consider a scenario where a researcher wants to investigate if a new educational intervention improves test scores. The null hypothesis is that the intervention has no effect. If the researcher conducts a study, fails to reject the null hypothesis, and concludes that the intervention has no effect, it would be a Type 2 error. In reality, the intervention could have a positive effect, but the study failed to detect it.\n",
